\section{Requirements}\label{sec:req}

\begin{framed}
2. Write a requirement specification with functional and non-functional requirements especially with focus on performance like throughput and latency. The functional requirements can be described in terms of use cases.
\end{framed}

The following functional and non-functional are stated for this report as they make up the system and architectural design:

\begin{itemize}
\item The system must be able to generate a new generation using the genetic algorithm.
\item The system must perform a simulation to evaluate the fitness of the generation using the Rosenbrock function.
\item The system should be able to generate a new generation in real-time. {\color{red} elaborate}
\item The system should be able to perform a simulation of a generation in real-time. {\color{red} elaborate}
\item The simulation should have user configurable parameters $a$ and $b$.
\item The user should be able to extract the generation and its fitness. {\color{red} really?}
\end{itemize}

The functional non-functional requirements are stated in the form of a use case.
