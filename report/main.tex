	In this report, a genetic optimization algorithm is modeled in SystemC, then verified and accelerated in an FPGA using Vivado's HLS tool to find if this kind of global search algorithm benefits from hardware acceleration. The results of comparing the algorithm evaluated on a standard general-purpose processor with the hardware accelerated version in terms of performance, energy usage and space are presented.

\section{Introduction}
Optimizing traditional software algorithms using hardware acceleration, like field-programmable gate array (FPGA's), is an active area of research and development due the potential decrease in latency and increase in throughput. With high-level synthesis (HLS) we refer to a process, where the actual logical description of system functionality is described in a abstract modeling language, like SystemC, before being synthesized to a hardware description language like VHDL or Verilog and then executed in a FPGA on a system-on-a-chip (SoC). This approach makes use of the hardware and software co-design methodology to create a computational specification model in software used to generate an architecture that can be deployed to hardware. This bring a shorter design time, a decrease in time to market and a opportunity to evaluate many potential design options. In this report, we use hardware and software co-design to describe, design and simulate a genetic optimization algorithm that finds global maximums or minimums on the Xiilinx ZyBo platform using Vivado's high-level synthesis (HLS) tool. The actual algorithm is modeled in SystemC, verified and then accelerated in an FPGA as an intellectual property (IP) core. To benchmark the algorithm, the non-convex Rosenbrock function is used.
